# CGN3405Numerical_Methods
These codes are used in a undergraduate course (CGN3405 Numerical Methods) for civil engineering at the University of Central Florida. I implemented some classic numerical methods in Python, including Approximated Errors, Graphical Methods, Bisection Methods, Newton-Raphson method, Naive Gauss Elimination, LU Decomposition, Matrix Inverse, Gauss-Seidel Method, Linear Regression, Newton's Interpolating Polynomial, Trapezoidal Rule, Euler's Method, and Heun's Method.
